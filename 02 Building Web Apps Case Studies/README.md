### Building Web Applications in R with Shiny: Case Studies
### Course Description

* After learning the basics of using Shiny to build web applications, this course will take you to the next level by putting your newly acquired skills into use. You'll get experience developing fun and realistic Shiny apps for different common use cases, such as using Shiny to explore a dataset, to generate a customized plot, and even to create a wordcloud. With all this practice and new knowledge, you should be inspired and well-equipped to develop Shiny apps for your own use!

## CHAPTER 1 Shiny Review

* In the first chapter, you'll review the essentials of Shiny development. You'll get re-introduced to the basic structure of a Shiny application, as well as some core Shiny concepts such as inputs, outputs, and reactivity. Completing this chapter will help refresh your Shiny knowledge and ensure you have the required skills to develop Shiny apps for real-life scenarios.

## CHAPTER 2 Make the perfect plot using Shiny
* Imagine you're preparing a figure for a manuscript using R. You spend a lot of time re-creating the same plot over and over again by re-running the same code but changing small parameters each time. The size of the points, the colour of the points, the plot title, the data shown on the plot—they all have to be just right before publishing the figure! To save you from the hassle of re-running the code many times, in this chapter you will learn how to create a Shiny app to make a customizable plot.

## CHAPTER 3 Explore a dataset interactively with Shiny

* After being impressed by the plot you created with Shiny, your supervisor now wants to get familiar with the dataset you used in the plot. He doesn't want to simply have a raw data file, he wants an interactive environment where he can view the data, filter it, and download it. This chapter will guide you in creating such an application—a Shiny app for exploring the Gapminder dataset.

## CHAPTER 4 Create your own word cloud in Shiny
* Your friend, who really likes word clouds, has written an R function for generating word clouds. She wants to share this function with all her friends, but not all of them know how to use R. You offer to help by building a Shiny app that uses her function to let people create their own word clouds. This will allow all her friends, even the ones who are unfamiliar with R, to generate word clouds using a point-and-click interface. This chapter will guide you through the steps required to build this app.
